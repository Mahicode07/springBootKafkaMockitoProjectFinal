In Java, an expression has two parts: operand and operator. The variables or constants that operators act upon are called operands.

1. Unary operator: The operator that acts on a single operand is called unary operator. It uses a single variable.

2. Binary operator: The operator that acts on two operands is called binary operator. It uses two variables.

3. Ternary operator: The operator that acts on three operands is called ternary operator. It uses three variables.

If a symbol like +, -, *, etc. is used as an operator, it is called symbolic operator.
If a keyword is used as an operator, it is called named operator.

1. Symbolic operators

Arithmetic operators:       +, -, *, /, etc.
Relational operators:       <, >, <=, >=, = =, !=.
Logical operators:            &&, ||, !.
Assignment operators:     =,
Increment and decrement operators: + +, – –
Conditional operators:     ?:
Bitwise operators:           &, !, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
Shift operators:               <<, >>, >>>.
2. Named operators
