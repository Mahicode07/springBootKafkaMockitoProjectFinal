FileInputStream in Java is the most basic file input stream class that is designed to read bytes from a file. I
n simple words, it reads data from a text file in the form sequence of bytes.
FileInputStream class is derived from InputStream that is abstract superclass of FileInputStream.
It implements Closeable and AutoCloseable interfaces.

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("myfile.txt");
chars = fis.read();

A FileOutputStream in Java is a concrete subclass of OutputStream that provides methods for writing
 data to a file or to a FileDescriptor.It stores data in the form of individual bytes.

 We can write both byte-oriented as well as character-oriented data via FileOutputStream class.
 But, for character-oriented data, it is recommended to use FileWriter than FileOutputStream.
 FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("fileout.txt");
 fos.write(ch); // write ch into file.

 BufferedReader in Java->
 is a buffering input character stream that reads text from the buffer rather
 than directly underlying input stream or other text sources.
 It adds the buffering capability to the underlying input character stream so
 that there is no need to access the underlying file system for each read and write operation.

 Java BufferedReader is good for two important things:
 1. It warps another Reader and adds a buffer that will read the text much faster and improves performance by buffering input.
 For example, InputStreamReader can be wrapped by BufferedReader to buffer input data taken from the underlying file.
 2. It provides a readLine() method to read a string of characters, arrays, and text lines.

 BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader inputStream);

 BufferedWriter in Java->
 is a Writer that buffers the stream of characters before writing them to an underlying output stream.
 It adds the buffering capability to the underlying output character stream,
 so that there is no need to access the underlying file system for each read and write operation.
 When a program writes to a BufferedWriter, the text is stored in the buffer.
 When the buffer is filled up or explicitly flushed, the text is moved to the underlying output stream
 that makes the writes much faster and improves the performance.
 BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer out);
---------------------------------------------------------

Serialization in Java->
is the process of writing the state of an object to a byte stream. In other words, it is the process by which we can
store (or save) the state of an object by converting it to a byte stream.
Once Java object state is converted into byte stream, it can be saved or stored into a hard disk, socket, file, or send over a network.
The class whose objects need to be serialized must implement the Serializable interface of java.io package.
Then we pass objects to ObjectOutputStream, which is connected to a file, and store objects to a file.

Serializable Interface in Java->
A serializable interface is a marker interface that defines no members
 If a class is serializable then all of its subclasses are also serializable.
 By default, String class and all the wrapper classes implement Serializable interface.

Deserialization in Java->
The process of converting byte stream (data) generated through serialization to object is called deserialization in java.
In simple words, the reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization.
Once the state of objects is stored in a file, they can be retrieved by reading back objects from
the file and used as and when needed.

Both serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent.
So, we can serialize an object in a platform and deserialize it in different platforms.

How to Perform Object Serialization and Deserialization in Java?->
first, connect objfile.txt file to FileOutputStream. It will write data into objfile.txt file.
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("objfile.txt");
2. Then, connect FileOutputStream to ObjectOutputStream by code below:
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
Now, call writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream to write objects to FileOutputStream,
which stores them into objfile.txt file.
public class SerializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);

        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("person.ser"))) {
            out.writeObject(person); // Serialize the person object
            System.out.println("Object serialized to person.ser");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

deserlization->
public class DeserializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Attempt to deserialize the object from file
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("person.ser"))) {
            Person person = (Person) in.readObject(); // Deserialize the object

            // Print the deserialized object
            System.out.println("Deserialized Object: " + person);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Any static and transient variables declared inside a class cannot be serialized.
These variables cannot be stored in a file. Static is the part of class, not object.

Non-serializable Data Fields->
Suppose a class that implements Serializable interface also contains non-serializable object data fields.
Can non-serializable data fields be serialized?
The answer is no. To enable the object not to be serialized, declare these data fields
with transient keyword to tell JVM to ignore them when writing objects to the byte stream.
public class A implements Serializable {
  private int x;
  private static float y;
  private transient B b = new B();
}

class B {    } // B is not serializable.

 If b is not marked transient, a java.io.NotSerializableException would occur.

Java Serialization with Array or Collection->
 An array or collection is serializable if all its elements are serializable.
 If any element is not serializable, the serialization process will be failed.

Externalization in Java->
Externalization in Java is a process that improves the performance of serialization
and deserialization mechanisms by complete control over what data fields are serialized and deserialized.
externalization is used to customize serialization and deserialization processes.
Java supports the externalization process by the externalizable interface. Implementing the Externalizable
interface by a class provides more control in reading and writing objects from/to a stream.
The main advantage of externalization over the serialization process is that everything is taken care of by the programmer.
JVM has no control over it. The complete serialization control goes to the application.

Externalizable Interface in Java->
Externalizable interface that extends Serializable interface
package java.io;
public interface Externalizable extends Serializable
{
   public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException;
   public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, java.lang.ClassNotFoundException;
}

Difference between Serializable and Externalizable in Java->
1. Serializable is a marker interface whereas, Externalizable is not a marker interface.
It provides two methods: writeExternal() and readExternal().
2.default serialization process/custom serialization process
3.care of by JVM and the programmer doesn’t have any control/only programmer have control
4.Externalizable interface is generally used when we want to store the output data in custom format that
is different from java default serialization format like csv, database, flat file, XML, etc.
5.Externalizable interface can improve the performance of serialization process if used correctly.
