Tokens in Java->
    A class is a container that contains a set of declaration statements and methods containing executable statements.
    A statement consists of variables, constants, operators, keywords, comments, identifiers, punctuators, etc.
    When the program is run, comments are stripped and executable statements are executed.

    A translation unit is a sequence of tokens: symbols, numbers, and words

    Tokens are the various elements in the Java program that are identified by Java compiler.
    A token is the smallest individual element (unit) in a program that is meaningful to the compiler.

    final double p = 3.14   which is made up of six tokens: “final”, “double”, “p”, “=”, “3.14”, and “;”.

    Java language contains five types of tokens that are as follows:
    Reserved Keywords->class, public, static, if, else,
    Identifiers->names given to elements, such as variables, methods, classes, and interfaces
    Literals->constants or fixed values in the program that don’t change during the execution of the program,integer, floating-point, character, string, and boolean literals.
    Operators-> Examples of operators are arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=), logical operators (&&, ||), etc.
    Separators->characters that separate elements within the program code

    The process of breaking down the source code into valid tokens is known as tokenization.
    Java language has currently reserved 50 words as keywords and these keywords are called reserved keywords.
    Data Type,Access Modifiers,Control Statement,Object and Classes

Rules for Naming Identifiers in Java
    It must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). It cannot begin with a digit
    It cannot be a reserved word
    It cannot be true, false, or null
    It can be of any length

Escape Sequence->
    System.out.println("He said "Java is fun unlimited""); compile time error
    ystem.out.println("He said \"Java is fun unlimited\""); o/p->He said "Java is fun unlimited"
