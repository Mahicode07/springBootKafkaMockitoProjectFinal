The underlying structure of all Java programs is made up of classes.
Anything we want to write in a Java program must be encapsulated in a class.

A class is a model to create objects. It means that we write properties and actions of objects in the class
Properties are represented by variables, and actions are represented by methods. So, a class consists of variables and methods.

Object in Java
    An object is a basic unit of an object-oriented programming language. It is any real-world thing that has properties and actions
    In other words, an entity that has state and behavior is known as object in Java. Here, the state represents properties,
    and behavior represents actions or functionality.

Characteristics of Object
    State->properties or attributes of an object,Behavior->represents functionality or action,Identity: Identity represents the unique name of an object

Class in Java->
    a class is a group of objects which are common to all objects of one type
    A class is basically user-defined data types that act as a template for creating objects of the identical type

Flow of Execution of Program in Java
    1. Out of five elements declared inside the class body, the static variable, static block, and static method are executed first during the loading of the dot class file.
    2. The instance variable is executed during object creation.
    3. When the object is created, first, an instance block is executed before the execution of a constructor.
    4. After the execution of an instance block, the constructor part will be executed.
    5. After the execution of the constructor part, the instance method is executed.
    6. The local variable is executed inside the method, constructor, or block.

College myCollege = new College();
    College ➝ Name of the class.
    myCollege ➝ Object reference variable which stores the address of the object in the stack memory.
    new ➝ keyword that stores the object in the heap memory.
    College() ➝ Constructor of the class.
    = ➝ The equal sign (=) is an assignment operator. It simply says to take the object created by a new keyword and assign it to the object reference variable.

Hash Code Number->
    When an object of class is created, the memory is allocated in the heap area to store instance variables.
    After the creation of an object, JVM produces a unique reference number (address) for that object. This unique reference number is called hash code number.

    This reference number is unique for all objects, except string objects.
    The address of the object is stored in the object reference variable in the stack memory.
    System.out.println(myCollege.hashCode()); // It will display hash code stored in myCollege.

Object Reference in Java->
    An object reference is a unique hexadecimal number that represents a memory address of the object. It is useful to access members of objects.

There are several ways to create an object of class in Java. They are as follows.
Using the new keyword
Using Class.forName
Using Clone.
Using Object Deserialization.
Using ClassLoader.

What is System.out.println()->
    1.System is a class that is pre-defined by the Sun Microsystem.
    2. out is a variable declared in System class of type PrintStream.
    3. println is a method defined in PrintStream class.

Ways to Initialize State(variable) of Object in Java ->
    By using constructor
    By using a reference variable
    By using a method.

The constructor should not have any return type even void also because if there is return type, then JVM would consider as a method, not a constructor.

constructor ->
Student()
   {
// Initialize states of an object, i.e. values of variables.
     name = "Shubh";
     rollNo = 05;
     age = 22;
   }

Marks mk = new Marks();
  // Initialize values of variables through object reference variable and dot notation.
     mk.subject1 = "Science";
     mk.sub1Marks = 90;
     mk.subject2 = "Maths";
     mk.sub2Marks = 99;

Rectangle rt2 = new Rectangle();
     rt2.perValue(50, 50);
     rt2.calculate();

      void perValue(int l, int b)
        {
     // Here, we are setting the name of parameters different from the name of the variables.
     // Because we are not using this reference.
           length = l;
           breadth = b;
        }

Life Cycle of Object in Java->
    Creation of .class file on disk
    Loading .class file into memory-> Java classloader loads that class into memory and then  Java runtime reads it into the memory.
    Looking for initialized static members of class
    Ways to initialize class in java->A class can be initialized in two ways in Java. First, when you access a static field or static method of the class.
    second way is when object or instance of the class is created using the new keyword, the class is initialized.
    Allocation of memory for object and reference variable
    Calling of the constructor of class->After allocating the memory, JVM calls the constructor of the class which is like a method but
    it is called only once when the object is created.
    Removing of object and reference variable from memory->When the accessing of field and methods are completed,
    the object and its reference are removed from the memory by the JVM.
    At this time the object has died.
    You don’t have to destroy objects yourself.
    Actually, when the object is no longer in use, Java runtime calls the garbage collector to destroy all the objects.
    Thus, objects are born, live, and die.

Anonymous Object in Java->
    An object which has no reference variable is called anonymous object in Java. Anonymous means nameless.
    So, an anonymous object is an object without a specific name or reference variable
    In other words, when we initialize an object, but we do not assign it to any reference variable, it is called an anonymous object. For example:
    new Student(); // anonymous object
    We can use an anonymous object at the time of object creation only. If you want to create only one object in a class, then the anonymous object is an excellent approach. Since an anonymous object has no name, we cannot access or reuse later in the code.
    new Student().display();

Advantages and Usage of Anonymous Objects in Java->
    An anonymous object simplifies code structure by eliminating the need for explicit object creation.
    It is especially useful for one-time operation where creating named objects would be unnecessary and cumbersome.
    It is ideal for scenarios where an object is needed only for a single method call.
    Usage of anonymous objects can make code more concise and readable because it eliminates the clutter of named object declarations and subsequent method calls.

Differences Between Anonymous and Named Objects
    Naming Conventions and Scope->
    Memory Utilization:Anonymous objects are automatically eligible for garbage collection after use

Types of Classes in Java->
    1. Concrete Class:A class whose object can be created and whose all methods have body is called concrete class.
    Java object class is a concrete class. A concrete class can have both static and non-static members.
                      It has no abstract methods.
    2. Static Class:In Java, static is a keyword that can be applied with variables, methods, inner classes, and blocks.
    We cannot declare a class with static keyword but inner class can be declared as static.
    3. Abstract Class:An abstract class is a class which is declared with abstract keyword. It is just like a normal class but has two differences
                      We cannot create an object of this class. Only objects of its non-abstract (or concrete) sub-classes can be created.
                      It can have zero or more abstract methods that are not allowed in a non-abstract class (concrete class).
                      An abstract class is sometimes also known as base class or superclass. It contains undefined and unimplemented abstract method bodies that are implemented and defined by derived classes
    4. Final Class:When a class is declared with final keyword, it is called final class in Java. Final class means Restricting Inheritance!. It does not allow itself to be inherited by another class.
    In other words, Java classes declared as a final cannot be extended (inherited). If you do not want to be a subclass, declare it final. A lot of classes in Java API are final.
    5. Inner Class:A class declared inside another class is known as nested class. The class which is a member of another class can be either static or non-static. When a member class is declared with static, it is known as static nested class.
    The member class which is non-static is known as inner class in Java
                   An inner class cannot have any kind of static member. So, the members of an inner class can be:
                   Instance variables
                   Instance methods
                   Constructors
                   Initializer block
                   Inner class


anonymous class in Java->
    An anonymous class in Java is a type of inner class that doesn't have a name and is declared and instantiated all at once.
    It's often used to override methods or provide specific implementations, particularly in situations where you don't want to create a separate class.

    class Animal {
        public void sound() {
            System.out.println("Some sound");
        }
    }

    public class AnonymousClassExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Creating an anonymous class that extends the Animal class
            Animal animal = new Animal() {
                @Override
                public void sound() {
                    System.out.println("Roar");
                }
            };

            // Calling the overridden method
            animal.sound();
        }
    }

Based on access modifiers types of class->
    1.public->A public class is visible and accessible from anywhere. The instance of public class can be created from any other class.
              When a class is declared as public, any program in any package can use the code or some of the code.
              But we do not put public with class, it is non-public (default) class.
    2.Private->An outer class (top-level class) cannot be declared with a private access modifier,
    but an inner class can be declared as private. An inner class is a member of outer class.
    3.Singleton Class:A singleton class in Java is a class that allows only one instance to be created.
    All its variables and methods will belong to just one instance. Singleton class concept is useful when we need to create only one object of class.
    4.Immutable Classes:Immutable classes are those classes whose instances cannot be modified after creation.
    They promote thread safety and are widely used in concurrent programming.
    5.Utility Classes:Utility classes, also known as helper classes, contain static methods that provide utility functions
    6.Enum Classes:Enum classes define a fixed set of constants that represents a specific type

Predefined Classes in Java->
    1. Object Class:2. Math Class:3. String Class:4. System Class:5. Random Class:


Can a class in Java be without any methods or fields?
Yes, a class in Java can be declared without any methods or fields. Such a class can still
be used to create objects, although these objects would have no specific behavior or
state
