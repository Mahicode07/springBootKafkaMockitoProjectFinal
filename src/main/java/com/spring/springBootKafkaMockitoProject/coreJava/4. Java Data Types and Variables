Primitive data types (also called intrinsic or built-in types)
Non-primitive data types (also called derived or reference data type)

Primitive data types in Java are those data types whose variables can store only one value at a time.
We cannot store multiple values of the same type.
These data types are pre-defined in Java. They are named by a keyword.

Every primitive data type has default values defined in java. When the programmer does not declare any value to the variables,
the JVM will assign default values during the object creation.

The default value of int is 0 (zero).
The default value of the byte is 0.

zero is considered a positive number.
float data type is used to represent the decimal number, which can hold 6 to 7 decimal digits.
double data type is also used to represent decimal numbers up to 15 decimal digits accurately

Boolean data type takes zero bytes of memory space because
boolean data type in Java is implemented by Sun Micro System using the concept of a flip-flop.

Difference between Primitive and Non-primitive Data types in Java
    1. Primitive data types are predefined in Java, whereas non primitive data types are created by programmers. They are not predefined in Java.
    2. In primitive data type, variables can store only one value at a time.
    On the other hand, in non-primitive data type, we can store multiple values either the same type or different type or both.
    3. All the data for primitive type variables are stored on the stack, whereas, for reference types, the stack holds a pointer to the object on the heap.
    4. In Java, primitive types begin with lowercase letters. Examples include int, double, float, boolean, char, short, long, and byte.
    On the other hand, non-primitive types typically begin with an uppercase letter. Examples include String, Integer, Double, ArrayList, Car, etc.
    5. The size of each primitive type is fixed and predefined.
    For instance, an int is always 32 bits, a double is always 64 bits, and so forth. On the other hand,
     references to non-primitive objects are of the same size.

Memory Allocation of Primitive, Non-primitive Data Types
    ➲ In Java, all data type for primitive type variables is stored on the stack.
    ➲ For reference data types, the stack holds a pointer to the object on the heap.
    When setting a reference type variable equal to another reference type variable, a copy of only the pointer is made.
    ➲ Certain object types cannot be manipulated on the heap.

Variables in Java
    A variable in Java is a container that holds the value during the execution of Java program.
    In other words, a variable is the name of the memory location reserved for storing value.

    Static: When the class is loaded into the memory, the memory is determined for the variables. Such variables are known as static variables or class variables in java.
            Static variable will get the memory only once. If anyone changes the value of the static variable using the class name,
            it will replace the previous value and display the changed value. This is because it is constant for every object created.
            All the static variables are stored in PermGen space of heap memory.

    local:A variable that is declared and used inside the body of methods, constructors, or blocks is called local variable in Java.
     It is called so because local variables are not available for use from outside.
          We must assign a local variable with a value at the time of creating.
          If you use a local variable without initializing a value, you will get a compile-time error like “variable x not have been initialized”
          We can not use access modifiers with local variables.
          A local variable cannot be static.only final keyword is permitted with local variables in the java program

          package localVariables;
          public class Student
          {
          // Declaration of constructor.
             Student()
             {
               String nCollege = "PIET"; // Declaration and initialization of local variable.
               System.out.println("Name of college: " +nCollege); // We can access local variable inside the constructor.
             }
          // Declaration of instance method.
            void subMarks()
            {
           // Declaration and initialization of local variables.
              int cMarks = 90;
              int pMarks = 85;
              int mMarks = 99;
              int totalMarks = cMarks + pMarks + mMarks;
              System.out.println("Total marks in PCM: " +totalMarks);
            }
          public static void main(String[] args)
          {
          // Create an object of class.
             Student s = new Student();
          // This statement will produce compile-time error because local variable cannot be accessed from the outside.
          // System.out.println("Name of college: " +nCollege);

          Local variables are stored in stack memory

              s.subMarks(); // Calling instance method.
           // System.out.println("Total marks in PCM: " + totalMarks); // Compile-time error.
             }
          }

          another program->

          package localVariables;
          public class Test
          {
           void m1() // Instance method.
           {
          // This statement will generate compile-time error
          // because public is an access modifier and we cannot declare access modifiers with local variables.
             public int x = 20;
           }
          public static void main(String[] args)
          {
             Test t = new Test(); // Creating object of class Test.
             t.m1(); // Calling m1 method.
            }
          }

    Instance Variables in Java->
         A variable that is declared inside the class but outside the body of the methods, constructors, or any blocks is called instance variable in Java.
         They are available for the entire class methods, constructors, and blocks.
         It is also called non-static variable because it is not declared as static.
         Instance variables are created when an object is created using the keyword ‘new’ and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
         We can also use access modifiers with instance variables. If we do not specify any modifiers,
         the default access modifiers will be used which can be accessed in the same package only
         It is not necessary to initialize the instance variable

         package instanceVariables;
          public class Test
          {
         // Declare instance variables inside the class, not inside the method, constructor, or block.
              int a = 30;
              int b = 40;
          // This method is called Static method.
             public static void main(String[] args) // main method.
             {
            // This area is called static area. So, you can access instance variables by using an object reference variable.
            // Creating an object of the class Test.
               Test t = new Test();
               System.out.println(t.a); // Accessing instance variable using object reference variable 't'.
               System.out.println(t.b);
             }
         // Declaration of instance method.
            void m1() // This method is called user-defined method.
            {
            // This area is called instance Area. So, we can access directly instance variables without creating any object.
               System.out.println(a); //Direct access.
               System.out.println(b); //Direct access.
            }
         }

         Each instance (object) of a class has its own copy of each variable.
         In other words, instance variables have their own separate copy of instance variable.
         If one object changes the value of a variable, it does not affect the value of other instance variables.
         All instance variables are stored in PermGen space (Permanent Generation space) of heap memory.
         If the variables are primitive type, then variable and its value both are stored as a name-value pair in the permgen.
         But if the variable is user-defined (object), then its reference is stored in PermGen but actually, it is stored in Young/old generation of heap memory

scope of variables->
    is a location (or region) of the program where the variable is visible to a program and can be accessible.
    When we create a local variable inside a method, constructor, or block, its scope only remains within the method, block, or constructor.
    It is visible only within the method, constructor, or block.
    When we define an instance variable inside a class, its scope is within the class.
     It is visible inside all the methods, constructors, and from the beginning of its program block to the end of program block in the class
    Within static methods and different classes, instance variables should be called using an object reference variable
    package variablePrograms;
    public class ScopeTest
    {
      int num = 20; // instance variable
      void m1()
      {
       int num = 30; // local variable
       System.out.println("Number: " +num);
       System.out.println("Number: " +this.num);
       }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      ScopeTest st = new ScopeTest();
       st.m1();
     }
    }
    Output:
           Number: 30
           Number: 20
           The local variable num within m1() method hides instance variable num.
           Therefore, when we will call m1() method from the main() method, the output will be displayed num equal to 20,
           even though there is also a num instance variable that equals to 30. In this case, we can use this.num to call the instance variable.
           It will print the output 20.

    When we define a variable with a static keyword inside the class, its scope is within the class.
    That is, the scope of a static variable is within the class.

Constants in Java->
    A value which is fixed and does not change during the execution of a program is called constants in Java. In other words,
    Java constants are fixed (known as immutable) data values that cannot be changed.

    Java supports various types of constants. They are as follows:

    Integer constants-numeric
    Real constants-numeric
    Character constants-non-numeric
    String constants-non-numeric

    In Java, we usually declare a constant with the static and final modifiers, which indicates that the value of the variable cannot be changed once it is initialized.
    We must declare constants in uppercase letters to make them easily distinguishable from other variables.
    Initialize the constant when you declare it. Since it’s declared with the final keyword,
    you must assign its value at the time of the declaration.
    If you define a constant with static and final keyword, you can also initialize it in the static initialization block.
