Choosing the right instance type depends on your application's specific resource
requirements and workload characteristics.
========================================================================================================================
What are Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in EC2, and how do you create custom AMIs for your applications?
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are pre-configured templates that contain the necessary information to launch an EC2 instance.
An AMI includes the operating system, application server, and applications required to run your software.
To create a custom AMI for your applications, follow these steps:
1. Launch an EC2 Instance:
- Start by launching a new EC2 instance using a base AMI that closely matches your requirements.
2. Configure the Instance:
- Install and configure your application, software, and any necessary dependencies on the instance.
3. Clean Up:
- Remove any temporary files, logs, or sensitive data that should not be included in the AMI.
4. Create the AMI:
- In the AWS Management Console, select the configured EC2 instance.
- Choose "Actions" > "Image" > "Create Image."
- Provide a name and description for the AMI, and configure any additional settings as needed.
5. Launch New Instances:
- Once the AMI is created, you can use it to launch new EC2 instances with the same configuration as the original
instance.
Custom AMIs allow you to quickly deploy multiple instances with your application pre-installed,
ensuring consistency and saving time in the deployment process.
========================================================================================================================
How can you secure your EC2 instances, and what are some best practices for enhancing EC2 security?

=========================================================================================================================
Explain Auto Scaling in EC2 and how it helps ensure application availability.
Auto Scaling in EC2 automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in demand.
It helps ensure application availability by:
1. Maintaining Desired Capacity: Auto Scaling keeps a specified number of instances running to handle the expected load.
2. Scaling Out: When demand increases, Auto Scaling launches additional instances to distribute the load.
3. Scaling In: When demand decreases, Auto Scaling terminates unnecessary instances to save costs.
4. Health Checks: Auto Scaling monitors the health of instances and replaces unhealthy ones to maintain application
availability.
5. Integration with Load Balancers: Auto Scaling works with Elastic Load Balancers to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
Overall, Auto Scaling ensures that your application can handle varying levels of traffic while optimizing costs.
=========================================================================================================================
What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store in EC2, and when would you use each type of storage?
EBS (Elastic Block Store) and Instance Store are two types of storage options available for EC2 instances:
1. EBS:
- Persistent block storage that remains intact even when the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.
- Suitable for data that needs to be retained, such as databases and application data.
- Can be easily backed up using snapshots and can be resized or attached to different instances.
2. Instance Store:
- Temporary storage that is physically attached to the host machine.
- Data is lost when the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.
- Ideal for temporary data, caches, or scratch space where data persistence is not required.
In summary, use EBS for persistent storage needs and Instance Store for temporary, high-performance storage requirements.
=========================================================================================================================
Explain the concept of EC2 instance metadata and user data.
EC2 instance metadata is a service that provides information about the instance,
such as its instance ID, public IP address, and security groups.
User data is a feature that allows you to run scripts or commands automatically when an EC2 instance launches.
You can use user data to install software, configure settings, or perform other setup tasks during the
instance initialization.
both data can be accessed from within the instance using a special URL
(http:// 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ for metadata and
http://  169. 254.169.254/latest/user-data/ for user data).
=========================================================================================================================
What is an EC2 placement group, and in what scenarios would you use it?
An EC2 placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that allows for optimized
network performance and low-latency communication between instances.
There are three types of placement groups:
1. Cluster Placement Group: Instances are placed close together in a single AZ for high network throughput
and low latency. Ideal for HPC applications.
2. Spread Placement Group: Instances are distributed across distinct hardware to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures.
Suitable for critical applications requiring high availability.
3. Partition Placement Group: Instances are divided into partitions, each on separate racks, to isolate failures.
Used for large distributed and big data applications.
You would use placement groups when your application requires high network performance, low latency, or enhanced fault tolerance.
=========================================================================================================================
How can you resize an EC2 instance, and what are the considerations when doing so?
You can resize an EC2 instance by stopping it, changing its instance type, and then starting it again.
However, it’s essential to ensure that the new instance type meets your application’s resource requirements
and that any instance-specific settings and data are preserved during the process.
=========================================================================================================================
What is an EC2 Spot Instance, and when would you use it?
An EC2 Spot Instance is a type of EC2 instance that allows you to bid on unused AWS capacity at significantly
reduced prices compared to On-Demand instances.
You would use Spot Instances for flexible, fault-tolerant applications that can handle interruptions,
such as big data processing, batch jobs, and background processing tasks.
They are ideal when cost savings are a priority, and your workload can tolerate potential instance termination.
