What is AWS CloudWatch? (Big Picture)
👉 Layman Language:
CloudWatch is like a CCTV + health monitor + alarm system for AWS.
It tells you:
Is my server running?
Is CPU high?
Did my app crash?
Should I add more servers?
Should I send an alert?

👉 If EC2 is the machine, CloudWatch is the doctor + security camera.
📘 Standard Definition:
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS
resources and applications to provide visibility and automated actions.

🧩 CLOUDWATCH COMPONENTS (AS SEEN IN AWS MENU)
1️⃣ Metrics
👉 Layman:
Metrics are numbers that show health.
Examples:
CPU usage
Memory usage
Disk usage
Network traffic
📘 Standard Definition:
Metrics are time-ordered data points that represent the performance of AWS resources.
📌 Examples:
EC2 CPUUtilization
ALB RequestCount
Lambda Duration
🔁 Metric Flow
EC2 running
 ↓
CPU usage measured
 ↓
Metric sent to CloudWatch

2️⃣ Logs
👉 Layman:
Logs are detailed written records of what happened.
Examples:
Error messages
Application output
Access logs
📘 Standard Definition:
CloudWatch Logs collect and store log files from AWS services and applications.

🔹 Log Group
👉 Layman:
A folder for logs.
📘 Standard:
A Log Group organizes related log streams.

🔹 Log Stream
👉 Layman:
A single source of logs (one EC2 or Lambda).
📘 Standard:
A Log Stream is a sequence of log events from a single resource.

🔁 Logs Flow

3️⃣ Alarms (MOST IMPORTANT)
👉 Layman
Alarms are alert rules.
Example:
CPU > 80% → send alert
Disk full → scale server
📘 Standard Definition:
CloudWatch Alarms monitor metrics and perform actions when thresholds are breached.
🔁 Alarm Flow
Metric (CPU)
 ↓
Alarm checks value

Action (SNS / ASG)

4️⃣ Dashboards
👉 Layman:
Dashboard is a single screen view of everything.
Like:
Car dashboard
Hospital monitor
📘 Standard Definition:
CloudWatch Dashboards provide customizable visualizations of metrics and alarms.
📌 Use Case:
Operations monitoring
Management overview

5️⃣ Events (Now called EventBridge)
👉 Layman:
Events are things that happen.
Examples:
EC2 stopped
User logged in
Auto Scaling launched instance
📘 Standard Definition:
CloudWatch Events / EventBridge delivers near-real-time notifications of changes in AWS resources.
🔁 Event Flow
EC2 stopped
 ↓
EventBridge detects event

Action (Lambda / SNS)

6️⃣ Insights (Advanced Analysis)
🔹 Logs Insights
👉 Layman:
Search & analyze logs using queries.
📘 Standard:
CloudWatch Logs Insights allows interactive log analysis using a query language.
📌 Example:
Find all ERROR logs in last 1 hour

🔹 Metrics Insights
👉 Layman:
Query metrics like a database.
📘 Standard:
CloudWatch Metrics Insights provides SQL-like queries for metrics.

7️⃣ Application Insights
👉 Layman:
Automatically detects application problems.
📘 Standard:
Application Insights identifies and diagnoses application issues using machine learning.
📌 Use Case:
App running on EC2 + RDS

8️⃣ ServiceLens
👉 Layman:
End-to-end application visibility.
📘 Standard:
ServiceLens integrates metrics, logs, and traces to provide application observability.

9️⃣ Synthetics (Canaries)
👉 Layman:
Fake users that regularly test your website.
📘 Standard:
CloudWatch Synthetics uses canaries to monitor endpoints and APIs.
📌 Example:
Check homepage every 5 minutes

🔁 Synthetics Flow
Canary runs
 ↓
Hits website/API
 ↓
Records success/failure
 ↓
Alarm if failed

🔟 Contributor Insights
👉 Layman:
Find who is causing the most load.
📘 Standard:
Contributor Insights identifies top contributors to metrics.
📌 Example:
Top IPs causing high traffic

Explain the difference between CloudWatch Alarms and CloudWatch Events. When and how would you use each?
Answer:
— CloudWatch Alarms are used to monitor metrics and trigger actions when a threshold is breached,
such as sending notifications or performing automated remediation.
— CloudWatch Events are used for event-driven automation and integration.
They capture events from AWS services and custom applications and can trigger actions based on those events.
Alarms are typically used for metric-based monitoring, while Events are used for event-driven actions.
========================================================================================================================
Explain the concept of CloudWatch Logs and Log Groups. How can you use them for centralized log management?
Answer: CloudWatch Logs are used to collect and store log data. Log Groups are containers for log streams.
You can use Log Groups to organize and manage logs from various sources.
Centralized log management involves aggregating logs into a central Log Group, making it easier to search,
analyze, and set up alarms on log data
========================================================================================================================
Explain the difference between CloudWatch Logs Insights and CloudWatch Events Rules.
When would you use one over the other?
Answer:
— CloudWatch Logs Insights is used for querying and analyzing log data. It helps you search and analyze log content.
— CloudWatch Events Rules are used for event-driven automation. They are set up to respond to specific events generated
by AWS services or custom applications. You would use Logs Insights for log analysis and Events Rules for
event-driven actions and integrations.
========================================================================================================================
What are CloudWatch Alarms’ actions and how can you use them to respond to events?
Answer: CloudWatch Alarm actions are the responses triggered when an alarm state is reached.
Actions can include sending notifications (e.g., via SNS), executing an Auto Scaling policy, or invoking a Lambda
function. These actions allow you to automate responses to events based on alarm conditions.
