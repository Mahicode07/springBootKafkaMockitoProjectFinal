Explain the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent IT infrastructure—such as servers,
storage, and networking—on a pay-as-you-go basis. AWS EC2 is a prime example of IaaS
Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers a framework for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
Elastic Beanstalk is an example
Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installations and maintenance on user devices

What is EC2?
It allows users to run virtual machines, known as instances, on-demand, enabling businesses to scale their computing resources up or down based on demand.
EC2 instances can be configured with various operating systems, including different distributions of Linux and Windows.
Key features of EC2 include:
Scalability: Users can launch multiple instances simultaneously and scale down or up as needed.
Flexibility: EC2 supports a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases, including compute, memory, and storage-intensive applications.
Pay-as-you-go pricing: Users are billed based on the actual usage of resources, which helps in managing costs effectively.
Integration: EC2 integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon RDS for database management and Amazon S3 for storage.

What is S3 and what are its main features?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service
S3 is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, making it a popular choice for backup, archiving,
big data analytics, and static website hosting.
Key features of S3 include:
Security: S3 provides multiple layers of security, including bucket policies, IAM roles, and server-side encryption.
Durability and availability: S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability, ensuring data is reliably stored and accessible.
Data Management: S3 offers features like versioning, lifecycle policies, and event notifications, allowing users to manage their data effectively.

What is the purpose of an IAM role?
key component of AWS security and governance. An IAM role is an AWS identity that has specific permissions defined for various AWS services.
Unlike IAM users, roles do not have permanent credentials (such as a username and password). Instead, they are assumed by trusted entities such as AWS services,
applications, or IAM users.
