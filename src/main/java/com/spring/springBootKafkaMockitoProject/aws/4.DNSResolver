🌐 What is Route 53? (Big Picture)
👉 Layman Language:
Route 53 is like the phone book of the internet.
Humans remember names → google.com
Computers understand numbers → 142.250.190.14
👉 Route 53 converts names into numbers so your browser knows where to go.

📘 Standard Definition:
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that translates domain names
into IP addresses and routes traffic to AWS resources or external endpoints.

🔁 BASIC FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)
User types: www.myapp.com
        ↓
Route 53 (DNS lookup)
        ↓
Returns IP / Load Balancer / Resource
        ↓
User reaches application

🧩 COMPONENTS UNDER ROUTE 53
1️⃣ Domain Name
👉 Layman:
A domain name is your website’s human-friendly name.
Example:
amazon.com
mycompany.in
📘 Standard:
A Domain Name is a unique, human-readable address used to identify resources on the internet.
📌 Route 53 lets you register and manage domains.

2️⃣ Hosted Zone
👉 Layman:
A hosted zone is like a contact list for a domain.
It stores all DNS rules for that domain.
📘 Standard:
A Hosted Zone is a container for DNS records that define how traffic is routed for a domain and its subdomains.
Types of Hosted Zones:
Public Hosted Zone → Internet-facing
Private Hosted Zone → Internal AWS only

3️⃣ Public Hosted Zone
👉 Layman:
Used when your website or app is accessible from the internet.
📘 Standard:
A Public Hosted Zone routes internet traffic to resources such as ALB, EC2, CloudFront, or external IPs.
📌 Example:
www.myapp.com → ALB

4️⃣ Private Hosted Zone
👉 Layman:
Used for internal communication inside AWS (not visible on internet).
📘 Standard:
A Private Hosted Zone routes traffic within one or more VPCs using private IP addresses.
📌 Example:
db.internal → RDS private IP

5️⃣ DNS Records (MOST IMPORTANT)
DNS records are instructions inside Route 53.

🔹 A Record
👉 Layman:
Maps name → IP address.
📘 Standard:
An A Record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
📌 Example:
myapp.com → 13.232.45.10

🔹 AAAA Record
👉 Layman:
Same as A record but for IPv6.
📘 Standard:
An AAAA Record maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.

🔹 CNAME Record
👉 Layman:
Points one name to another name.
📘 Standard:
A CNAME Record maps a domain name to another domain name.
📌 Example:
blog.myapp.com → myapp.medium.com
⚠️ Cannot be used for root domain (myapp.com).

🔹 Alias Record (AWS Special)
👉 Layman:
Alias is like a smart CNAME for AWS services.
📘 Standard:
An Alias Record maps a domain name to AWS resources such as ALB, CloudFront, S3 without additional cost.
📌 Example:
myapp.com → ALB
✅ Works on root domain
✅ Free DNS queries

🔹 MX Record
👉 Layman:
Tells where emails should be delivered.
📘 Standard:
An MX Record specifies mail servers responsible for receiving email.

🔹 TXT Record
👉 Layman:
Used for verification & security.
📘 Standard:
A TXT Record stores text information for domain verification and security policies.
📌 Example:
Google verification
SPF, DKIM, DMARC

6️⃣ Routing Policies (CORE FEATURE OF ROUTE 53)
Routing policy decides HOW traffic is routed.
🔀 Simple Routing
👉 Layman:
One road → one destination.
📘 Standard:
Simple routing routes traffic to a single resource.

⚖️ Weighted Routing
👉 Layman:
Split traffic by percentage.
📘 Standard:
Weighted routing distributes traffic based on assigned weights.
📌 Example:
Version A → 80%
Version B → 20%

🌍 Latency-Based Routing
👉 Layman:
Send users to nearest server.
📘 Standard:
Latency-based routing routes traffic to the region with the lowest latency.

🏥 Health Check Routing
👉 Layman:
If one server is sick, Route 53 avoids it.
📘 Standard:
Health check routing routes traffic only to healthy endpoints.

🔁 Failover Routing
👉 Layman:
If primary fails → backup takes over.
📘 Standard:
Failover routing switches traffic to a secondary resource when the primary becomes unhealthy.

🌐 Geolocation Routing
👉 Layman:
Route users based on country or region.
📘 Standard:
Geolocation routing routes traffic based on user’s geographic location.

🧭 Geoproximity Routing
👉 Layman:
Route based on distance, adjustable with bias.
📘 Standard:
Geoproximity routing routes traffic based on geographic location with bias control.

7️⃣ Health Checks
👉 Layman:
Route 53 checks your app regularly to see if it’s alive.
📘 Standard:
Health checks monitor endpoint availability and allow Route 53 to route traffic away from unhealthy resources.

8️⃣ Route 53 Resolver
👉 Layman:
Helps AWS and on-premise networks talk to each other using DNS.
📘 Standard:
Route 53 Resolver provides DNS resolution between VPCs and on-premises networks.
