it is platform like bookmyshow , make my trip etc

functional requirements->
// 1. users should be able to book tickets for different events (movies, concerts, flights, trains, buses, etc.)
based on title,location,time,date
user should able to see the available seats, description of event, reviews and ratings.
user should do the book that ticket of event

non-functional requirements->
scale of system- 10m daily active users
cap theorem -> currently required both (highly availabe in case of searching and seeing the events)
and need consistency in case of booking the tickets.

core entities->
1.User
2.Event(movie,concert,flight,train,bus)
3.Ticket
4.Payment
5.Venue

API Designing->
1. GET-> v1/search/q={searchTerm}-> should return list of eventIds: pagination
searchTerm can be title,location,time,date
2. GET-> v1/event/{eventId}-> should return event details,location and seats available
3. POST-> v1/event/{eventId}/reserve-> should reserve seats temporarily for a user-> return bookingId
Request body: { "userId": "123", "seats": ["A1", "A2"] }
5. POST-> v1/bookingId/payment-> based on bookingId should make payment and confirm booking
Request body: { "paymentMethod": "CREDIT_CARD", "details": { ... } }
6. GET-> v1/user/{userId}/bookings-> should return list of bookings
7. DELETE-> v1/booking/{bookingId}/cancel-> should cancel the booking and free up seats

High Level Design->
based on 10m DAU we need to go with microservice architecture
and with the help of horizontal scaling we can scale the system

then we need to introduce API Gateway to distribute the load
and calls the booking service which going to interact with db

but here only one booking service will be there which are doing all operations
so instead we can go with creating microservice for each of business operation
1. Search Service
2. Event Service
3. Booking Service
4. Payment Service
