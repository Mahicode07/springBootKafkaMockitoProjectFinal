illegal parking->
1.vehicle can not park in already occupied slot
2.vehicle can not park in slot which is not designated for that vehicle type
3.vehicle can not vacate slot without payment

classes to be created->
1.abstract class Vehicle{
    String vehicleNumber;
    VehicleType vehicleType; // Enum for different vehicle types (CAR, BIKE, TRUCK, etc.)
    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
2.class Car extends Vehicle{
    // Additional attributes specific to cars
    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
// Similarly, create classes for Bike, Truck, etc.

3. class ParkingLot{
List<ParkingSlot> parkingSlots;
}
4. class ParkingSlot{
    VehicleType slotType; // Enum for different slot types (CAR_SLOT, BIKE_SLOT, TRUCK_SLOT, etc.)
    boolean isOccupied;
}
5.interface PaymentStrategy{
    void pay(double amount);
}

approaches->
factory pattern can be used to create different vehicle types
strategy pattern can be used for different payment methods
singleton design pattern can be used for parkingManagement->only one instance of parking management should exist
observer pattern can be used for notifying when a slot is freed or occupied
