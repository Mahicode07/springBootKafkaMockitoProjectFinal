what is a test suite in junit and mockito?
A test suite is a bundle of multiple unit test cases which can be run together.
We can use @RunWith and @Suite annotations over the test class for running the test suite.
@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({TestClass1.class, TestClass2.class})
public class TestSuite {
}
In the above example, TestClass1 and TestClass2 are two test classes that will be executed together as part of the TestSuite.
We can also create nested test suites by including other test suites in the @SuiteClasses annotation.
We can also use Mockito along with JUnit in a test suite to mock dependencies and verify interactions.

how to create a test suite in junit and mockito?
To create a test suite in JUnit and Mockito, follow these steps:
1. Create multiple test classes that contain your unit test cases.
Each test class should be annotated with @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) if you are using Mockito for mocking dependencies.
2. Create a new class that will serve as the test suite. Annotate this class with @RunWith(Suite.class) and @Suite.SuiteClasses({TestClass1.class, TestClass2.class})
where TestClass1 and TestClass2 are the test classes you created in step 1.
3. In the test suite class, you can also include other test suites by adding them to the @SuiteClasses annotation.
4. Run the test suite class as a JUnit test to execute all the test cases in the included test classes.
